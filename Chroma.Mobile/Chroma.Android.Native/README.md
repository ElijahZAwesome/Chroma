# Chroma Native Android Library

This library is just SDLs Native -> Android implementation, but wrapped in a library we can put in Managed Land so that we get autogenerated bindings.

# Instructions

In any java compatible Jetbrains IDE, you can build the project by going to File -> Project Structure -> Artifacts, Pressing +, then JAR -> From module with dependencies. Then press OK. Press OK again and now you can build the jar by pressing Build -> Build Artifacts.

# TODO

This should be automated based on the current version of SDL because almost all of the code except for `libsdlActivity.java` is literally just directly ripped out of SDLs source code. The only difference being getLibraries(), which needs to load our additional Chroma dependencies.
